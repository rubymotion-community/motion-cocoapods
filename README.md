# motion-cocoapods

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HipByte/motion-cocoapods.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HipByte/motion-cocoapods) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/motion-cocoapods.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/motion-cocoapods)

motion-cocoapods allows RubyMotion projects to integrate with the
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) dependency manager.


## Installation

```
$ [sudo] gem install motion-cocoapods
```

Or if you use Bundler:

```ruby
gem 'motion-cocoapods'
```


## Setup

1. Edit the `Rakefile` of your RubyMotion project and add the following require
   line:

   ```ruby
   require 'rubygems'
   require 'motion-cocoapods'
   ```

2. Still in the `Rakefile`, set your dependencies using the same language as
   you would do in [Podfiles](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html).

   ```ruby
   Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
     # ...
     app.pods do
       pod 'AFNetworking'
     end
   end
   ```

   You can use `use_frameworks!` to install pods as frameworks (**NOTE** This feature requires RubyMotion 4.18+).

   ```ruby
   Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
     # ...
     app.pods do
       use_frameworks!
       pod 'AFNetworking'
     end
   end
   ```

3. If this is the first time using CocoaPods on your machine, you'll need to
   let CocoaPods do some setup work with the following command:

   ```
   $ [bundle exec] pod setup
   ```


## Tasks

To tell motion-cocoapods to download your dependencies, run the following rake
task:

```
$ [bundle exec] rake pod:install
```

That’s all. The build system will properly download the given pods and their
dependencies. On the next build of your application it will pod the pods and
link them to your application executable.

If the `vendor/Podfile.lock` file exists, this will be used to install specific
versions. To update the versions, use the following rake task:

```
$ [bundle exec] rake pod:update
```

## Options

If necessary, you can pass `vendor_project` options to the `pods` configuration
method. These options are described [here](http://www.rubymotion.com/developers/guides/manuals/cocoa/project-management/#:~:text=bar.rb.-,2.6.%20Vendoring%203rd%2DParty%20Libraries).
For instance, to only generate BridgeSupport metadata for a single pod, which
might be needed if a dependency that you’re not using directly is causing issues
(such as C++ headers), you can specify that like so:

```ruby
   Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
     app.pods :headers_dir => 'Headers/AFNetworking' do
       pod 'AFNetworking'
       # ...
     end
   end
```

By default the output of CocoaPods doing its work is silenced. If, however, you
would like to see the output, you can set the `COCOAPODS_VERBOSE` env variable:

```
$ [bundle exec] rake pod:install COCOAPODS_VERBOSE=1
```

## Contribute

1. Setup a local development environment.

   ```
   $ git clone git://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods.git
   $ cd motion-cocoapods
   $ [bundle exec] rake bootstrap
   ```

2. Verify that all the tests are passing.

   ```
   $ [bundle exec] rake spec
   ```

3. Create your patch and send a
   [pull-request](https://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
